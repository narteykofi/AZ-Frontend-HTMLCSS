    <h1>This is my very first html Page</h1>
    <p>This page is the <u>first assigment</u> for my <i>course work on</i> <b>front ende development studies</b></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        As an IT engineer studying front-end development, I see myself in the next five years as a highly skilled and experienced front-end developer. 
        <br>
        I will be working on a variety of projects, including building and maintaining websites and web applications, 
        <br>
        developing new features and functionality, and optimizing performance and user experience.
        
        I will be using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create innovative and engaging user interfaces.
        <br> 
        <i>I will also be using my IT engineering skills to develop and implement scalable and efficient front-end solutions.</i>
        
        I will be working with a team of other front-end developers, back-end developers, designers, and product managers to 
        create products that meet the needs of our users.
        <br>
        I will also be staying up-to-date on the latest front-end development technologies and trends.
        <br>
        In five years, I see myself as a <u>leader in the front-end development community.</u> 
        <br>
        <b>I will be sharing my knowledge and expertise with others through blog posts, tutorials, and presentations. 
            <br>
            I will also be contributing to open-source projects and helping to shape the future of front-end development.</b></p>
